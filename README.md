# LaunchGUI
First iteration of final launch control GUI for our liquid rocket.

## Dependencies and Running
- Make sure you have Python (3+) installed. 
- Make sure you have pip, or any package manager you are familiar with.
- Install PyQt6: ex - ```pip install PyQt6```
- Install pyqtgraph ex - ```pip install pyqtgraph```
- Install pyserial: ex - ```pip install pyserial```
- To run the program, you may click run in an IDE of your choice
- Or, type ```python3 main.py``` (linux) or ```py main.py``` (windows) from inside the directory where the repository is located.
- If you do not execute the program in the correct directory, you may see that the program cannot "find" certain files. If you are having this issue, try to switch to the correct directory. Alternatively, you can try editing the constants (in blue caps) at the top of the file. Look for the ones that indicate a file path, and replace them with the full path of the file. For example, ```r"C:\Users\Bobjoe\programs\AV-Waterflow-GUI-V2\src\errorIcon.png"``` will replace ```"./src/errorIcon.png"```
